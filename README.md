Snapchat Live, for everyone!
===============

The small script allows you to emulate Snapchat Live (or [Our Story, whatever they seem to be calling it](https://support.snapchat.com/a/our-story)) by creating a user account which adds the snaps (currently only supports images), to its story for all to see.
